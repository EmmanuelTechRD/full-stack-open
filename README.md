Starting with the [FullStackOpen Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), where, as they say, I expect to:

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript all at once! This course will introduce me to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single-page applications with ReactJS, which utilize REST APIs built with Node.js.
